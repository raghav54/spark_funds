Business and Data Understanding
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

For your analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country

STRATEGY : Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors.
